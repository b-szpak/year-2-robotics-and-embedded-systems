Example work from my 2nd Year University Robotics Module. A program to make an Arduino buggy travel an exact 1.0m distance from its starting direction, accounting for any displacements due to obstacles.

## License
See repository's attached LICENSE.

## Result of Project
The file "Robotics_Assignment.X.production.hex", found under "dist/default/production", was uploaded onto the Ardunio buggy and then run as its default program.
